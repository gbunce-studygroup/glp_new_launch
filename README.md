# Global Landing Page Framework v2 - New partner lauch version

### A modified version of the Global Landing Page (v2) framework for creating launch pages for new partners. This framework utilizes the same shared components as the standard landing page but has less pre-defined variables to allow for greater control of component styles.

#### CSS, scripts, fonts & images should all be output to the same 'globallandingpagesv2' location in the Designer folder as standard landing pages, but should be filed inside a 'launch' directory.

#### For example: *Designer > css > globallandingpagesv2 > lipscomb > launch*
